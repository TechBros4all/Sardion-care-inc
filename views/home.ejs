                        <p>Every child should have the opportunity to reach for their dreams. Over 35 years, Youth
                            Villages has worked to radically improve the lives of children across the country through an
                            array of program models and services built around preserving and restoring families. We do
                            what works — partner with others to expand our reach and advocate for positive, long-term
                            change in child welfare, juvenile justice and children’s mental health systems.</p>

                                for high risk youth and large sibling groups: Placements for siblings in one home will
                                ensure the family connectives and we have several houses designed to provide a home for
                                siblings.We believe in the importance of skilled and therapeutic intervention to
                                stabilize behaviour; enhance the self-worth and dignity of each individual; and to
                                promote healing of childhood neglect, abuse and trauma by using holistic values.</p>
